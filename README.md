# "Recipe-Book-of-the-Future": Collaborative-Data-Management-System-for-Dynamic-Recipe-Sharing

### Overview:
This project will focus on creating a dynamic recipe-sharing platform that allows users to collaborate and share cooking recipes with version control, data lineage, and real-time editing. Users will be able to upload and modify recipes, track changes made by others, and revert to previous versions. The system will also feature query functionality for finding recipes based on ingredients, cooking methods, or dietary restrictions, and a recommendation engine to suggest recipes based on user preferences.
The project will use data management principles such as version control (like Git for code but for recipes), query languages to filter recipes, and collaborative data sharing. 

### Key Features:
1. Recipe Version Control: Users can create new recipes, modify existing ones, and track changes over time, similar to Git versioning.
2. Collaborative Editing: Multiple users can contribute to a recipe, and changes are tracked and attributed to the contributors.
3. Query Recipes by Attributes: A query system allows users to search for recipes based on ingredients, cooking methods, preparation time, and dietary preferences.
4. Ingredient Substitution: Users can search for substitute ingredients or modify recipes based on available items.
5. Personalized Recipe Recommendations: A recommendation engine will suggest recipes based on user preferences and past activity.
6. Data Integrity and Privacy: Keep track of who edits the recipe and when, ensuring that the data remains consistent and accurate.
7. Mobile-Friendly Interface: Allow users to use the system through mobile devices for convenient access in the kitchen.
